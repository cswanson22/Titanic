This was my initial attempt at creating a model using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.  We first applied some basic feature engineering (including one-hot encoding and feature combination) as a preprocessing step -- afterwards, we applied a k-nearest-neighbors model to make predictions on passenger survival.  After training our model using a range of k-values, we found our best model to occur with k=6, which resulted in a validation accuracy of 83.15%.
